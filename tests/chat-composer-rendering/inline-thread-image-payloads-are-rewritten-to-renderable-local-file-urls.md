### Feature: Inline thread image payloads are rewritten to renderable local file URLs

#### Prerequisites
- Start app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Have a thread that includes a user inline image block originally stored as a `data:` payload.

#### Steps
1. Open the thread in the chat UI.
2. Confirm the message area where the inline image appears.
3. Open Network tab and inspect `POST /codex-api/rpc` `thread/read` response.
4. Verify image block now has `type: "image"` and `url` with `file://...` (not `data:`).

#### Expected Results
- Inline `data:` image payload is not sent in RPC response.
- UI still renders the image from the generated local file URL.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.
