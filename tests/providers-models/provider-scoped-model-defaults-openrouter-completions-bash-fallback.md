### Provider-scoped model defaults + OpenRouter completions bash fallback

#### Feature/Change Name
Model defaults are stored per provider (no cross-provider leakage), and OpenRouter `Completions` mode preserves shell-tool execution by routing tool-capable requests through Responses compatibility.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running (`pnpm run dev`)
2. Open Settings panel
3. OpenRouter key configured

#### Steps
1. Switch provider to `OpenRouter` and choose a specific OpenRouter model in composer selector
2. Switch provider to `Codex`
3. Choose a Codex model different from the OpenRouter one
4. Switch back to `OpenRouter`
5. Verify previous OpenRouter model selection is restored
6. In OpenRouter settings, set API format to `Completions`
7. Send: `what codex cli version is? it should run bash commands`

#### Expected Results
- Provider switch restores the last model used for that provider
- OpenRouter model does not leak into Codex provider model list/selection, and vice versa
- In `Completions` mode, the assistant can still invoke bash/tool execution flow and return the CLI version result

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Set provider/model/api format back to preferred defaults
