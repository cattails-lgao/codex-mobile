### Feature: Revert PR #16 mobile viewport and chat scroll behavior changes

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- A thread exists with enough messages to scroll.
- Test on a mobile-sized viewport (for example 375x812).

#### Steps
1. Open an existing thread and scroll up to the middle of the chat history.
2. Wait for an assistant response to stream while staying at the same scroll position.
3. Send a follow-up message and observe chat positioning when completion finishes.
4. Open the composer on mobile and drag within the composer area.
5. Open/close the on-screen keyboard on mobile and verify the page layout remains usable.

#### Expected Results
- Chat behavior matches pre-PR #16 baseline (no PR #16 scroll-preservation logic active).
- No regressions from reverting PR #16 changes in conversation rendering and composer behavior.
- Mobile layout no longer includes PR #16 visual-viewport sync changes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Re-apply PR #16 commits if the reverted behavior is not desired.
