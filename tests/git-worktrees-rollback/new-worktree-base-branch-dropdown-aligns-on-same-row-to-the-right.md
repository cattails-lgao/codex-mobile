### Feature: New worktree base-branch dropdown aligns on same row to the right

#### Prerequisites
- Start the app from this repository (`pnpm run dev`).
- Open `New thread` and select a Git project folder.

#### Steps
1. On desktop width (>=1024px), switch runtime to `New worktree`.
2. Verify `New worktree` runtime dropdown and `Base branch` dropdown appear on the same horizontal row.
3. Verify `Base branch` control is positioned to the right of runtime mode control.
4. Switch runtime back to `Local project`.
5. Verify branch dropdown disappears while runtime control remains aligned.
6. Resize viewport to mobile width (~375px) and switch back to `New worktree`.
7. Verify controls stack vertically for mobile readability.

#### Expected Results
- Desktop: runtime and branch controls are on one row, with branch selector on the right.
- Local runtime hides the branch selector without breaking layout.
- Mobile view stacks controls vertically.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.
