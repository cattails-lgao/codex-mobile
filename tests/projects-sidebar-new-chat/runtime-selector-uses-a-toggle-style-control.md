### Feature: Runtime selector uses a toggle-style control

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.

#### Steps
1. On the home/new-thread screen, locate the runtime control below `Choose folder`.
2. Verify both options (`Local project` and `New worktree`) are visible at once without opening a menu.
3. Click `New worktree` and confirm it becomes the selected option style.
4. Click `Local project` and confirm selection returns.
5. Set Appearance to `Dark` in Settings and verify selected/unselected contrast remains readable.

#### Expected Results
- Runtime mode is presented as a two-option toggle (segmented control), not a dropdown menu.
- Clicking each option immediately switches the selected state.
- Selected option has a distinct active background/border in both light and dark themes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Leave runtime mode and appearance at the previous user preference.
